# EMERGENCY DEPLOY - CLEAR RENDER CACHE

This file forces a new deployment to clear Render cache.

Timestamp: 2025-08-07T16:10:00Z
Reason: Render is serving stale cached version with old bugs

## Issues Fixed:
- ✅ merit -> seminar ENUM fix
- ✅ booking reference format fix (3-digit -> 4-digit) 
- ✅ removed manual booking reference generation
- ✅ let database auto-generate proper format

## Current Status:
Render cache is serving old version with:
- `merit` enum error (should be fixed)
- `FZ250807786` format error (should be fixed)

DEPLOY THIS VERSION NOW!
